The console is where output goes.

	console.log();
	outputs(logs) things to the console.

Semicolons are not always needed but it is good practice to add them at the end of statements anyways.

There are 4 main data types
	Strings
	Numbers
	Booleans
	Null

A declaration of a data type is called an instance

Every instance has properties

Strings have a property of length

	"string".length;
	returns the length of the string.

Every instance also has methods(member functions basically)

You can also call methods without an instance by using a library

There are many libraries that have references

When we call a function, we evaluate its arguments

/*
